		<h2>About me</h2>
			<div class="text">
				I my name is Aneta Kozak and a few months ago, I made a decision to change the industry. Until now, I have worked in the office administration department. However, this profession did not provide me with opportunities for professional development, which is very important to me. For several months, I have been devoting my free time every day to prepare as best as possible for my future job. I am extremely motivated and willing to expand my knowledge.<br /><br />
				In my case, software testing gradually developed from a field of interest into determined actions. I focus on acquiring knowledge, which resulted in getting the ISTQB Certificate. In order to grow as a Software Quality Assurance Specialist / Software tester I want to learn from more experienced colleagues and get to know the processes of producing software in practice.<br /><br />
				I am a motivated person, full of enthusiasm and willingness to work. I like new challenges and learn new things. I have an analytical mind, problem solving and research skills. I make new friends easily, and working in a group is not a problem for me.
