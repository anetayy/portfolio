			<p>My Name is Aneta Kozak and I live in KrakÃ³w. Few months ago, I made a decision to change the industry in which I work. Until now, I have worked in the office administration department. However, this profession did not provide me with opportunities for professional development, which is very important to me and I don`t feel satisfied with the work I do anymore.<br />
			That`s why, I decided to try my hand at IT... and I love it! ðŸ˜‰ <br />

			First thing I did was passing the ISTQB certification which gave me theory behind software testing processes and, as I thought, it would help me to stand out in the job market. But I didn`t feel that I know enough and I am ready... so the real journey inside the IT world begins ðŸ˜‰ <br />
			I started from python course on udemy. The begginings were difficult, all these loops, conditions, methods.. magic! But once I understand the basics it was much easier to learn new concepts. Then it comes time for databases along with SQL query languege that helps with persisting state of programms I wrote in python. Because my main goal was to prepare for work as a tester, between python and database sessions I was discovering the secrets of REST API, HTTP protocol and computer networks.<br />
			But theory is not enough, right? <br />
			That`s why I started looking for places where I could gain some testing experience in practice. I found great services uTest and cherry-it which are crowd testing platforms. I had the opportunity to test web and mobile application there. Also I learn under the watchful eye of mentors how to prepare bug reports along with collecting needed logs and other bug documentation like screeenshots and videos. <br />
			And after learning all these things I realized that it was just a beggining therefore the journey continues and I try to learn something new every day.
